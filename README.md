(below instructions written my profucius to remind myself how this works)

**HOW THIS WORKS** 

I forked this from the main branch for use in Heroku, a web app that builds Github apps as a website. 

**DEPLOYING AN UPDATE** 

Heroku is set to auto-deploy when the main branch I forked from is updated. Any files that are changed will be auto-overwritten.

**WHITELISTING BRIDGES** 

The whitelist.txt file is manually created by me to enable only the bridges I want to use. When the whitelist-default.txt file is updated, it is overwritten by the main branch. This can be ignored. **But when new bridges are added, you must manually add them to whitelist.txt**

**LINK TO HEROKU** 

https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/rssy-bridge/deploy/github

Go to Deploy > Deploy Branch (at the bottom under manual, if you need it to update instantly)
